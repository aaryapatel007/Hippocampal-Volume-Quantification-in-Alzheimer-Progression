Here we do inference on a DICOM volume, constructing the volume first, and then sending it to the
clinical archive

This code will do the following:
    1. Identify the series to run HippoCrop.AI algorithm on from a folder containing multiple studies
    2. Construct a NumPy volume from a set of DICOM files
    3. Run inference on the constructed volume
    4. Create report from the inference
